          <h1>JUST FUCKING USE ASTRO</h1>
          <p>
            <em
              >(Unless you're building an actual app, you sweet, fragile,
              over-engineering dipshit motherfucker.)</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Most sites are content plus a few interactive bits.</strong
            ><br />
            If you're shipping a full SPA for a fucking marketing site, you're not
            "modern." You're a goddamn irresponsible jackass, lazy as shit with architecture,
            and actively making the web a worse fucking shithole for everyone. Fuck
            you.
          </p>
          <h2>What the fuck is this shit?</h2>
          <p>
            This is a public service announcement for braindead dumbass
            motherfucking developers still building websites like it's 2012 <em
              >or</em
            > 2022 and acting proud of it like they invented sliced fucking bread,
            you absolute morons.
          </p>
          <p>You've got two equally stupid fucking religions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>"No frameworks ever."</strong>
              Congrats, you fucking idiot — you rebuilt a worse CMS with worse routing,
              worse builds, and zero goddamn guardrails. Your shitty site is one
              junior dev away from collapsing into an unreadable pile of HTML sadness,
              tears, and your own fucking incompetence, dipshit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"SPA for everything."</strong>
              Congrats, you pretentious motherfucker — you shipped hundreds of kilobytes
              of JavaScript bullshit to render a headline, three buttons, and your
              fragile fucking ego. Your users didn't consent to running your frontend
              thesis in their browser, you selfish piece of shit asshole.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Astro exists because most of the goddamn web is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>fucking pages</li>
            <li>fucking content</li>
            <li>fucking navigation</li>
            <li>fucking forms</li>
            <li>a couple fucking interactive widgets</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Not a goddamn desktop application duct-taped into a browser tab with
            delusions of grandeur, you delusional assclown.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Astro instead of "pure HTML" nirvana bullshit?</h2>
          <p>
            Because "pure HTML" at scale is a fucking lie you tell yourself
            until the site hits page 37 and everything quietly catches fire and
            burns down around you like your pathetic career, motherfucker.
          </p>
          <p>Then this shit happens, asshole:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              you copy and paste layouts like it's 2009 and you've learned
              absolutely fucking nothing, you braindead bastard
            </li>
            <li>
              your "tiny bit of JS" becomes a cursed spaghetti altar of
              suffering and bullshit
            </li>
            <li>
              content turns into an untyped clusterfuck no one fucking
              understands
            </li>
            <li>
              the build process becomes duct tape, shell scripts, prayers, and
              eventual fucking alcoholism because of your incompetence
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Astro gives you structure without forcing you into "everything must
            be client-side or you're a fucking coward," you spineless shit.
          </p>
          <p>You get, motherfucker:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              components without joining a goddamn JS framework cult like a
              brainwashed idiot
            </li>
            <li>actual layouts instead of copy-paste hell, dumbass</li>
            <li>
              sane file-based routing that doesn't make you want to fucking
              scream
            </li>
            <li>
              typed content collections so you stop shipping broken frontmatter
              like a fucking amateur piece of shit
            </li>
            <li>
              the ability to use React, Vue, Svelte, or whatever the fuck <em
                >only</em
              > when needed
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And yes, this is still true in December 2025:
            <strong>Astro ships zero client-side JavaScript by default.</strong>
            No tricks. No asterisks. No bullshit hydration tax. Nothing.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Why Astro instead of defaulting to React for every goddamn thing,
            you fucking sheep?
          </h2>
          <p>Because React is great.</p>
          <p>For apps, dipshit.</p>
          <p>
            Most websites are not fucking apps, no matter how much you
            desperately want them to be, you delusional motherfucker.
          </p>
          <p>If your site is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>marketing pages</li>
            <li>docs</li>
            <li>a blog</li>
            <li>landing pages</li>
            <li>
              an ecommerce <em>front</em> (not a client-side shopping simulator for
              masochists)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            …then shipping a full SPA is like bringing a fucking forklift to
            carry a sandwich, then congratulating yourself for "scalability" and
            "best practices," you insufferable jackass.
          </p>
          <p>
            Astro is the "HTML-first, JS-when-needed" workflow that SPA
            developers
            <em>say</em> they follow and then immediately ignore like the lying motherfucking
            bastards they are.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Islands: the thing you'll nod about and still fucking misuse like
            the idiot you are
          </h2>
          <p>
            Here's the mental model. Pay the fuck attention, dipshit
            motherfucker.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your page is static by default.</strong><br />
            <strong
              >Interactivity is the exception, not the fucking rule.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Want a carousel? Fine. Make it an island.<br />
            Want a pricing toggle? Island.<br />
            Want search? Island.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything else stays server-rendered, boring, fast, and quiet —
            like a well-behaved website that respects its users.
          </p>
          <p>That fucking means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              dramatically less JavaScript shipped to innocent users who didn't
              ask for your bullshit
            </li>
            <li>fewer hydration nightmares that wake your dumbass up at 3am</li>
            <li>
              fewer "why did this fucking re-render?" panic attacks and Slack
              meltdowns
            </li>
            <li>
              a page that works immediately instead of after a JS warm-up ritual
              from hell that you created, asshole
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You don't need to hydrate the fucking world, you absolute moron.<br
            />
            You need to hydrate the <em>one</em> damn widget and leave the rest the
            fuck alone, jackass.
          </p>
          <h2>The "I need a framework" reality check, motherfucker</h2>
          <p>Just fucking use Astro when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              your site is mostly content with some UI sprinkled on top, dumbass
            </li>
            <li>
              SEO actually matters and isn't just bullshit buzzwords in your
              shitty deck
            </li>
            <li>
              you want components without paying a stupid fucking SPA
              performance tax
            </li>
            <li>
              you want React or Svelte only where it makes sense, not everywhere
              like a goddamn lunatic
            </li>
            <li>
              your interactivity is localized instead of infecting the whole
              goddamn page like a fucking virus
            </li>
            <li>
              you want a site that doesn't turn into a maintenance nightmare at
              50+ pages because you're too stupid to plan ahead
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you're thinking "but I can do that with vanilla JS" — yes, and
            you can also eat soup with a fucking fork, you masochistic dipshit.
            Stop pretending that suffering equals skill, you self-righteous
            martyr asshole.
          </p>
          <h2>When you should not use Astro, dumbfuck</h2>
          <p>Astro is not your magic wand if you're building:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              a heavy client-side app with shared state everywhere, jackass
            </li>
            <li>real-time collaborative tools for fuck's sake</li>
            <li>
              interfaces where literally everything is interactive all the
              fucking damn time
            </li>
            <li>
              complex offline-first behavior that you'll probably fuck up anyway
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If your UI is basically a constantly running program, stop
            cosplaying as a website like a fucking poser and just fucking use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>React / Next, motherfucker</li>
            <li>SvelteKit, asshole</li>
            <li>Remix, dipshit</li>
            <li>
              whatever your incompetent team actually understands without
              fucking crying
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Astro is for sites that behave like websites — with selective "app"
            bullshit only where it belongs.
          </p>
          <h2>"But what about bloat?" — Shut the fuck up</h2>
          <p>
            If you use Astro correctly, it <strong
              >does not ship what you don't use</strong
            >. That's the whole fucking point, genius. Are you fucking stupid?
          </p>
          <p>
            If your Astro site ships 500KB of JavaScript, congratulations: you
            ignored the entire goddamn philosophy and rebuilt a SPA like a
            complete fucking idiot. You dumb motherfucker.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's not Astro's fault, dumbass. That's you being addicted to
            unnecessary complexity like it's fucking heroin. Get help, asshole.
          </p>
          <h2>The real problem isn't Astro vs React, you moron</h2>
          <p>
            The real problem is developers who can't evaluate the fucking job
            and treat tool choice like a personality trait or a religion. You're
            the fucking problem, asshole.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some dipshits build everything like it's a brochure from 1997.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other dumbfucks build everything like it's Figma plus Firebase
              plus a goddamn existential breakdown and a mental fucking crisis.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Pick based on reality, not your pathetic feelings, you emotional
            wreck:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Website?</strong> Fucking Astro, dumbass.</li>
            <li><strong>App?</strong> Full framework, moron.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mixed?</strong> Astro with islands, you fucking genius — finally
              getting it, shithead?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Stop treating tools like identity, you insecure motherfucker.<br />
            It's engineering. Act like a goddamn professional for once in your worthless
            career.
          </p>
          <h2>Now go ship something fast, asshole</h2>
          <p>
            If you're building a mostly-content website and still reaching for a
            full SPA like a fucking amateur:
          </p>
          <p>
            you're not being advanced, dipshit.<br />
            you're being lazy, insecure, and shit at trade-offs like the incompetent
            motherfucker you are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go build something that loads fast, ships less JavaScript, and
            doesn't actively hate your users, you piece of shit. Now fuck off
            and code.
