        <h3>(Unless you’re building an actual app, you sweet little over-engineer)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Most sites are content + a few interactive bits.</strong><br
          />If you’re shipping a full SPA for a marketing site, you’re not
          “modern.” You’re a careless selfish piece of shit.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>What the hell is this?</h2>
        <p>
          This is a slap in the face for people building websites like it’s 2012 <em
            >or</em
          > 2022.
        </p>
        <p>You’ve got two bad religions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>“No frameworks ever.”</strong> Congrats, you reinvented a worse
            CMS with worse routing and worse builds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>“SPA for everything.”</strong> Congrats, you shipped 300KB of
            JS to render a headline and three buttons.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Astro exists because most of the web is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>pages</li>
          <li>content</li>
          <li>navigation</li>
          <li>forms</li>
          <li>a couple interactive widgets</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not a goddamn desktop app in a browser.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Why Astro instead of “pure HTML” nirvana?</h2>
        <p>
          Because “pure HTML” at scale is a lie you tell yourself until the site
          hits page 37.
        </p>
        <p>What happens next:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you copy/paste layouts everywhere</li>
          <li>your “simple” JS turns into a cursed spaghetti shrine</li>
          <li>content becomes an untyped mess</li>
          <li>the build pipeline becomes duct tape and prayers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Astro gives you structure without forcing you into “everything is
          client-side.”
        </p>
        <p>You get:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            components (without committing to a single JS runtime religion)
          </li>
          <li>real layouts</li>
          <li>sane routing</li>
          <li>content collections (aka: stop shipping broken frontmatter)</li>
          <li>the ability to add interactivity <em>surgically</em></li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Why Astro instead of defaulting to React for everything?</h2>
        <p>Because React is great for apps.</p>
        <p>Most websites are not apps.</p>
        <p>If your site is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>marketing pages</li>
          <li>docs</li>
          <li>blog</li>
          <li>landing pages</li>
          <li>
            ecommerce <em>front</em> (not the entire cart logic living client-side)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          …then shipping a full SPA is like bringing a forklift to carry a
          sandwich.
        </p>
        <p>
          Astro is the “HTML-first, JS-when-needed” workflow that SPA people
          pretend they’re doing, but never actually do.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Islands: the thing you’ll pretend you understand</h2>
        <p>Here’s the mental model:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your page is static by default.</strong><br /><strong
            >Interactivity is an exception.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Want a carousel? Fine. Make it an island.<br />Want an interactive
          pricing toggle? Island.<br />Want search? Island.
        </p>
        <p>Everything else should stay server-rendered and quiet.</p>
        <p>That means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>less JS shipped</li>
          <li>fewer hydration headaches</li>
          <li>fewer “why is this re-rendering” meltdowns</li>
          <li>
            faster perceived performance because the page is usable immediately
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You don’t need to “hydrate the world.”<br />You need to hydrate the <em
            >one</em
          > damn widget.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>The “I need a framework” checklist</h2>
        <p>Just use Astro when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>your site is mostly content + UI</li>
          <li>SEO and initial render actually matter</li>
          <li>you want components but not an SPA tax</li>
          <li>
            you want to mix React/Svelte/Vue <em>only where it makes sense</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            your “interactivity” is localized (filters, toggles, nav, forms,
            small tools)
          </li>
          <li>you want a site that stays maintainable at 50+ pages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you’re thinking “but I can do that with vanilla JS” — yes, and you
          can also cut your lawn with scissors. Doesn’t mean you should.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>When you should not use Astro</h2>
        <p>Astro is not your savior if you’re building:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a heavy client-side app with complex shared state everywhere</li>
          <li>real-time collaborative interfaces</li>
          <li>
            app-like navigation where everything is an interaction surface
          </li>
          <li>complex offline-first behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the UI is basically a running program all the time, skip the
          cosplay and use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>React / Next</li>
          <li>SvelteKit</li>
          <li>Remix</li>
          <li>whatever fits your team</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Astro is for sites that behave like websites — with selective “app”
          bits.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>“But what about bloat?”</h2>
        <p>
          If you build Astro properly, the bloat is the point: <strong
            >it doesn’t ship what you don’t use.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          If your Astro site ships 500KB of JS, congratulations:<br />you
          rebuilt a SPA inside a tool designed to avoid that.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s not Astro’s fault — that’s you being addicted to unnecessary
          complexity.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>The real problem isn’t Astro vs React</h2>
        <p>It’s developers who can’t evaluate the job.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some people build everything like it’s a brochure.</li>
          <li>
            Others build everything like it’s Figma + Firebase + a midlife
            crisis.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pick based on the shape of the product:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Website?</strong> Astro.</li>
          <li><strong>App?</strong> Full framework.</li>
          <li><strong>Mixed?</strong> Astro with islands.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Stop treating “tool choice” like identity.<br />It’s engineering. Act
          like it.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Footer</h3>
        <p>
          If you’re building a mostly-content website and you’re still reaching
          for a full SPA:<br />you’re not being advanced.<br />you’re being lazy
          with architecture.
        </p>
        <p>Now go ship something fast.</p>
